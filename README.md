## Playing the Game

Running the game requires the module `pygame`, which is not a standard one.
It is recommended to create a **virtual environment** and install `pygame` there.
Ensure you have `virtualenv` installed:

```
sudo apt install virtualenv
```

Then, create the virtual environment, activate it and install the module:

```c
virtualenv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
```

If you are using an IDE like VSCode, you may need to change the Python interpreter to the one located inside the virtual environment: 
`./.venv/bin/python`
